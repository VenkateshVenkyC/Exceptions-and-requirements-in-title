# Title Search and Examination: Exceptions and Requirements

### Understanding exceptions and requirements in title insurance is essential for a smooth real estate transaction. Below is a structured breakdown covering definitions, examples, and key considerations.

## 1. What are Exceptions?

In title insurance, **exceptions** are specific issues or encumbrances excluded from coverage by the title policy. These highlight defects or conditions that the insurer will not cover, ensuring buyers and lenders are aware of any existing limitations on the property.

### Common Types of Exceptions:

- **Easements**: Rights granted to others to use a part of the property, often for utilities or access roads.
- **Liens**: Claims on the property for unpaid debts (e.g., tax liens, mechanics' liens).
- **Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs)**: Rules affecting the property, typically in subdivisions or HOA communities.
- **Mineral Rights**: If previous owners sold mineral rights, the current owner might lack access to those resources.
- **Zoning and Building Codes**: Title insurance excludes coverage for any zoning or code violations.
- **Boundary Discrepancies**: Differences between property boundaries shown in deeds vs. surveys.

### Why Are Exceptions Important?

- They alert buyers to any limitations or potential issues.
- They protect the title company from future liability related to these issues.

## 2. What are Requirements?

**Requirements** are conditions that must be met to ensure a clear, marketable title before issuing title insurance. These requirements address any title defects or issues that could affect ownership rights.

### Common Requirements:

- **Payoff of Existing Liens**: All liens must be satisfied before closing.
- **Resolution of Title Defects**: Any unresolved claims or missing information in the chain of title must be cleared.
- **Document Submission**: Required documents (e.g., deeds, lien releases, affidavits) must be provided.
- **Property Tax Payments**: Outstanding taxes need to be paid in full.
- **Survey of Property**: A new survey may be required to confirm boundaries or detect easements.
- **Probate or Legal Proceedings**: Legal issues, such as probate, must be completed if the property is part of an estate.
- **Execution of Documents**: All deeds or agreements must be signed, notarized, and recorded.

### Why Are Requirements Important?

- They ensure that the buyer receives a clear title free from undisclosed claims or disputes.
- Fulfilling requirements allows the title company to issue a title policy confidently.

## 3. How Exceptions and Requirements Work Together

### Before the Title Policy is Issued:
- **Exceptions**: Identified during the title search, exceptions are listed in the preliminary title report. The buyer, seller, and lender review these to understand potential unresolved issues.
- **Requirements**: A list of actions needed to clear the title is provided by the title company, which must be completed before closing.

### At Closing:
- Once all requirements are fulfilled (e.g., liens cleared, documents recorded), the title company issues a title policy for the buyer and lender. This policy will cover the property, excluding the listed exceptions.

## 4. Examples of Exceptions and Requirements

### Example 1: Utility Easement
- **Exception**: The title policy lists an existing utility easement as an exception, meaning the utility company has the right to use a portion of the property.
- **Requirement**: The title company may require confirmation that the easement does not interfere with the propertyâ€™s marketability.

### Example 2: Unpaid Property Taxes
- **Exception**: Unpaid taxes create a lien on the property. The title policy may not be issued until these taxes are resolved.
- **Requirement**: The title company requires that the seller pay any outstanding taxes before closing to clear the lien.

## 5. Presenting Exceptions and Requirements Effectively

### Suggested Presentation Approach:

1. **Definitions**: Start by defining "exceptions" and "requirements" in simple terms.
2. **Visual Aids**: Use a flowchart to illustrate how exceptions are identified, requirements are listed, and the process of resolving these items before closing.
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: Share examples from personal experience or common cases in real estate transactions.
4. **Engage the Audience**: Invite the audience to share similar experiences or questions to make the content relatable.
5. **Summary**: Reinforce the importance of understanding both exceptions and requirements to ensure a successful transaction.

This structured format ensures clarity, helping your audience understand and refer to these concepts easily.
